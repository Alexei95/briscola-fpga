# Briscola for FPGA
This is a simple Briscola card game written in VHDL,
developed for the Artix 7 Nexys 4 board developed by Digilent and Xilinx.
## History
This project was developed as part of the Computer Architecture course held
at the Polytechnic of Turin, under the supervision of Professor Paolo Montuschi and Professor Luca Sterpone.
## Developers
The developers are: Alessio "Alexei95" Colucci (https://github.com/Alexey95)
and Simone Longobardi, both studying Electronic Engineering, and Paolo Notaro, studying Computer Engineering.
## Future
The project is not going to be developed any further,
but it has been released as open source under the MIT License,
so for anyone to use and develop it is completely free aside from mentioning the previous developer group.
